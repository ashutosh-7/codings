PROBLEM---
In the game of PUBG, there are two friends in the same team, PUBG developers introduced a new health boost kit. Team has only single health boost kit . Initially, first and second player's health is p and q respectively . You can use health kit only after completion of a minute.
In a single minute, player's health either decreases by 2 percent (if not using health kit) or boosts up by 1 percent (if using health kit).Game continues until both players are alive.If any of the player has 0 health, then game finishes.
Hence, if at the beginning of a minute some player's health is 1 , he/she has to use the health kit, otherwise the team is eliminated. Find the maximum number of minutes that team can survive in a game of PUBG . Both players must be active throughout the whole game. Player's health has no limit.

Input
The first line of the input contains two positive numbers p and q(1 ≤ p,q≤ 100), the initial health of both players respectively.

Output
Output the maximum number of minutes that the team can last.

Sample Test Case : 

Input

3  5

Output

6
Explanation :
at the beginning of the first minute health kit is taken by first player, by the end of this minute first player is at health 4, second is at 3

continue the game without changing health kit, by the end of the second minute the first player health is at 5, second is at 1

at the beginning of the third minute give health kit to the second player, after this minute the first player is at 3, the second one is at 2

continue the game without changing health kit, by the end of the fourth minute first player health is at 1, second one is at 3

at the beginning of the fifth minute health kit taken by first player, after this minute the first player is at 2, the second one is at 1

at the beginning of the sixth minute health kit taken by second player, after this minute the first player is at 0, the second one is at 2

After that the first player died and the game is stopped













SOLUTION---

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int m,n,c=0,d=0,e=0,f=0;
	cin>>m>>n;
	d=m;e=n;
	if(m>n)
	{
		while(m>n)
		{
			m-=2;
			n+=1;
			c++;
		}
	}
	else{
		while(m<n)
		{
			n-=2;
			m+=1;
			c++;
		}
	}
	while(m>0&&n>0)
	{
	if(m>n)
	{
		m-=2;
			n+=1;
			c++;
	
	}
	else{
		n-=2;
			m+=1;
			c++;
	}
	}
if(d==1&&e==1)
{
	cout<<"0";
}
else
	cout<<c;
	return 0;
}
